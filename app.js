//You assign values to variables using the equals sign(let var = 12)
//You change the value of a variable using the equals sign after the varioable has been declared(var=12)

//declaring a variable is allocating space in memory for a new variable using the let, var or const keywords. Assigning a variable is giving it a value using the equals sign. Defining a variable is the same as declaring a variable
//Pseudocoding is creating a code/english hybid algorithm to wrap your head around the problem before you start on it so the code is easier to implement
