// Variables and Datatypes

// // A. Q + A
// How do we assign a value to a variable?
// We use the '=' token to assign value to a declared variable.
// ex. let a = 'assigned'

// How do we change the value of a variable?
// We change the value of a variable by reassigning the variable with a new statement.
// ex. a = 'changed'

// How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
// If I understand the question correctly, we declare the new variable, and put the existing one after the '='.
// ex. let b = a

// Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
// To declare a variable is to allocate memory for it. To define it is to assign the declared variable a value.
// ex. let c (declare variable c) = (assign) 'cupcake' (definition) > (= 'cupcake') is where we define variable c.

// What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
// Pseudocoding is the act of writing out code in plain English before going about trying to actually write it in
// JavaScript (or another language). We should do it because it helps us to lay out our objectives and plan of attack in
// more natural language before we go about trying to take the steps and piece by piece use them to create JavaScript code.
// I think in some way it could be like writing an outline of a paper before you even write the first draft.

// What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem
// vs actually typing in code to solve it?
// We should spend the vast majority of our time thinking about how we're going to solve a problem
// before we go about actually writing the code. I still struggle with this concept because I feel like just going in and
// writing some JavaScript helps to break the ice and get me thinking. Even if I have to scrap everything and start all over,
// it helps me to get through the process of solving the problem.

// // B. Strings

// // 1. Create a variable called firstVariable.
// let firstVariable
// // Assign it the value of the string "Hello World"
// firstVariable = 'Hello World'
// // Change the value of this variable to some number.
// firstVariable = 11
// // Store the value of firstVariable in a new variable called secondVariable
// let secondVariable = firstVariable
// // Change the value of secondVariable to any string.
// secondVariable = "string cheeze"
// // What is the value of firstVariable?
// 11

// // 2. Create a variable called yourName and set it equal to your name as a string. Then, write an expression that takes
// // the string "Hello, my name is " and the variable yourName so that it returns a new string with them concatenated.

// let yourName = "Tristan";
// let introduction = "Hello, my name is " + yourName


// // C. Booleans

// // Using the provided variable definitions, replace the blanks so that all log statements print true in the console.
// // Answers should be all be valid JS syntax and not weird things that don't make sense but happen to print true to the console.
//   const a = 4;
//   const b = 53;
//   const c = 57;
//   const d = 16;
//   const e = 'Kevin';

//   console.log(a < b);
//   console.log(c > d);
//   console.log('Name' === 'Name');
//   console.log(true !== false);
//   console.log(false === false || false === false ||false === false || true);
//   console.log(false === false)
//   console.log(e === 'Kevin');
//   console.log(a + b === c);
//   console.log(a * a === d);
//   console.log(48 !== '48');
