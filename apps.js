//A 
/*1. we assign a value of a variable using the = asignment operator.
2. we reasign the value using = operator
3. let a new variable and set it equal to your first varible 
4. declare is to alociate space on memory for a varible, we then use the assignmet operator = to assign our new varible a value. 
5.pseudocoding is the process of writting out your plan for coding a oriject on paper, this allows you to plan ahead for problems that might arrive in the immediate future.
Doing this also alows you to go into a project with a plan so your not blindly coding.
6. we should spend 75-90% planning and 25-10% coding.
