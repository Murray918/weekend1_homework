How do we assign a value to a variable?     We assign it with an equal sign. let x = 0

How do we change the value of a variable?   By re assigning the value with an equal sign. x = 3

How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?  Take the original variable and add it to a new one with an equal sign. let x = y 

Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define? Declare and define are the same thing. Declare is allocating space for a new variable. Assign is assigning a variable a value. 

What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?    Writing code out on paper, before actually starting the code.

What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?   90% thinking about it and 10% actually coding.
