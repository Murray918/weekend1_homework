// Variables and Datatypes

// // A. Q + A
// How do we assign a value to a variable?
// We use the '=' token to assign value to a declared variable.
// ex. let a = 'assigned'

// How do we change the value of a variable?
// We change the value of a variable by reassigning the variable with a new statement.
// ex. a = 'changed'

// How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
// If I understand the question correctly, we declare the new variable, and put the existing one after the '='.
// ex. let b = a

// Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
// To declare a variable is to allocate memory for it. To define it is to assign the declared variable a value.
// ex. let c (declare variable c) = (assign) 'cupcake' (definition) > (= 'cupcake') is where we define variable c.

// What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
// Pseudocoding is the act of writing out code in plain English before going about trying to actually write it in
// JavaScript (or another language). We should do it because it helps us to lay out our objectives and plan of attack in
// more natural language before we go about trying to take the steps and piece by piece use them to create JavaScript code.
// I think in some way it could be like writing an outline of a paper before you even write the first draft.

// What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem
// vs actually typing in code to solve it?
// We should spend the vast majority of our time thinking about how we're going to solve a problem
// before we go about actually writing the code. I still struggle with this concept because I feel like just going in and
// writing some JavaScript helps to break the ice and get me thinking. Even if I have to scrap everything and start all over,
// it helps me to get through the process of solving the problem.
